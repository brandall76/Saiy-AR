# Saiy® Android - Augmented Reality

An augmented reality visualisation of Saiy

## About

Built using [ARCore](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk) this application allows users to visualise Saiy in the world around them. From navigating busy streets, to chilling watching Netflix with you - and of course, using the bathroom.

Synchronised with APIs exposed by the full Saiy application, your Assistant responds and reacts in real time to commands.

However you envisage Saiy, you’ll be able to bring the Assistant of your chosen gender, build, style and appearance to life, supporting full customisations and behavioural idiosyncrasies.

Want to go a stage further? That would be the face mapping feature. It’s just wrong.

I need to clarify the most appropriate for the GNU Affero General Public License - will revisit very soon. Any suggestions welcome.
